To Install: Despite my best efforts there are some node_modules for development, so you'll need to run `npm i`.

To Build: `tsc` in the top level folder. This will build to dist.

To deploy: Copy the `index.html` and `dist/script.js` to any static file server.

## Linting

I used eslint (it seems like tslint is deprecated). `npm install` to set up.
