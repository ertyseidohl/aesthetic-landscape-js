To Install: No local deps. You'll need to have `tsc` installed somewhere (e.g. `npm install -g typescript`).

To Build: `tsc` in the top level folder. This will build to dist.

To deploy: Copy the `index.html` and `dist/script.js` to any static file server.

## Linting

I used eslint (it seems like tslint is deprecated). `npm install` to set up.
